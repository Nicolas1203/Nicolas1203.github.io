Hello there :wave:

Congrats for finding this website amongst all my [homonyms](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors&mauthors=nicolas+michel&hl=fr&oi=ao). I am a Post Doctoral Researcher at [The University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/), in the [Computer Vision and Media Lab](https://www.cvm.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/), under the supervision of [Professor Yamasaki](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?hl=ja&user=rE9iY5MAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). I was awarded a grant of 2 years from the [Japan Society for the Promotion of Science](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/).

My scientific interests lie in Deep Learning and Computer Vision. More specifically **Online Continual Learning**, **Representation Learning**, **Knowledge Distillation**, **Prompt Learning**. You can find out all my publications on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OyXkV0QAAAAJ&hl=en&scioq=nicolas+michel). You can also find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-michel-4166b7113/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/Nicolas1203).

I will probably add more information about myself one day but you get the big picture, probably.

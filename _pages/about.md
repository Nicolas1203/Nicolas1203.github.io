Hello there :wave:

Congrats for finding this website amongst all my [homonyms](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=nicolas%20michel&btnG=Search&as_sdt=800000000001&as_sdtp=on). I am a 4th year PhD student, close to defending. The exact date will be out soon, stay tuned if you are interested!

My scientific interests lie in Deep Learning and Computer Vision. More specifically **Online Continual Learning**, **Representation Learning** and **Knowledge Distillation**. You can find out all my publications on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OyXkV0QAAAAJ&hl=en&scioq=nicolas+michel). You can also find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-michel-4166b7113/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/Nicolas1203).

**This website is clearly not finished yet!** Please ignore all Einstein-related content :sweat_smile:

I will probably add more information about myself here but you get the big picture, probably.
